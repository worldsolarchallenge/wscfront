    <h1>Who's in front?</h1>

    <p>It is difficult to tell who is winning when teams were driving under different conditions in different parts of the world. However, we can say that team A <em>dominates</em> team B if its average driving speed is higher and it uses less energy per distance travelled.</p>

    <p>The following graph shows average driving speed and energy consumption for each of the teams. A team dominates another if it is lower and to the right.</p>

    <p>The next diagram shows which teams dominate which other teams.</p>

    <p>You can see distance travelled using <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#earth-pro">Google Earth Pro</a>. Download and open <a href="BWSC2021.kml" download="BWSC2021.kml">BWSC2021.kml</a>. The cars started in Adelaide and are heading north along the Stuart Highway.
