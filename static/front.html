    <h1>Who's in front?</h1>

    <p>It is difficult to tell who is winning because the teams are driving under different conditions. However, we can say that team A <em>dominates</em> team B if it has travelled further in the allowed time and has used less total energy.</p>

    <p>The following graph shows distance travelled and energy consumption for each of the teams. A team dominates another if it is lower and to the right.</p>

    <p>The next diagram shows which teams dominate which other teams.</p>
